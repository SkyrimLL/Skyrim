## Typically you would remap races/classes/icons that dont have an image or icon pack available so they do not appear blank. 
# All remaps follow this convention: Type(Npc, Race, Class)|Id|IconLabel. .For npcs and classes, Id is their FULL name. For races, ID=EditorId. IconLabel is the name of the image to remap to that is defined in an ini in the player/npc/races folder.
# Some examples are below.
# Class|Lucien's Class|ClassWarmonger# Lucien's class has no skill weights. His class icon would end up being the default. If using class icons this would remap his class to show the warmonger class icon.
# Npc|MyCustomFollower|KhajitMale02# This would remap a custom follower to use the KhajitMale02 icons in the player folder.
# Race|_00ArmoredSkeletonRace|SkeletonRace# This would remap skeletons in Skyrim immersive creatures to use the SkeletonRace image as opposed to defaulting to the undead type image.
# Npc|Hoth|NordMale02 This would remap hoth to use the NordMale02 image in the player male folder
