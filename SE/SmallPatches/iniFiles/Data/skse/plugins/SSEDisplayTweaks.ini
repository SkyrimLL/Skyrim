## Stretch game window across the entire screen in borderless fullscreen mode.
#
#  Use with a flip SwapEffect option for best results.
#
#  Note: For optimal performance and full feature support when upscaling, your

#  Options starting with 'flip_' indicate DXGI flip model, a relatively new feature which greatly improves borderless
#  fullscreen performance. While testing I couldn't notice any difference in performance compared to exclusive fullscreen mode.
#  In contrast, the old presentation model suffers lower FPS and noticeable stuttering. Additionally, many features which used
#  to require exclusive fullscreen now work in borderless. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that G-Sync works without having
#  to enable it for windowed mode.
#
#  WARNING: Don't use flip model in exclusive fullscreen mode, the game might freeze on start.
#
#  Read more about DXGI flip model here: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/dxgi-flip-model/
#
#  It's recommended to leave this on auto as the best option will be selected based on detected capabilities.

#  Note: Flip model requires at least Windows 8.1 (only flip_sequential supported), but I highly recommend Windows 10 Spring 
#        Creators update or later if you want the best experience.

## Number of frames allowed to be queued for rendering. 
#
#  NOTE: This option was renamed in 0.3.8. In earlier versions the option had no effect.
#
#  Valid range: 1-16 (0 leaves it at default)
#
#  Bethesda default is 2 for SE, 1 for AE.
#
#  WARNING: Values above 2 could have a negative impact on overall performance.
#
#  Tip:
#
#    Try NVIDIA's ultra low latency mode or AMD anti-lag, it may work even better. There 
#    were still occasional stutters with MaxFrameLatency=1 depending on what I was looking 
#    at, ULLM eliminated them completely.

#    Note that ULLM has a fixed FPS penalty. It seems that this is by design. The delta is larger
#    with higher fps, for example when you'd normally get 144 you'll see around 138 with latency set
#    to ultra.
#
#    Keep in mind that driver control panel settings take precedence so this option will be

## Maximum allowed monitor refresh rate. Applies only in exclusive fullscreen mode.
#
#  This overrides Bethesda's hardcoded limitation of 60Hz. The game will request the highest 
#  available refresh rate (as reported by DirectX), but there is no guarantee you'll actually
#  get it. It's completely up to your system.
#
#  You DO NOT NEED TO MESS WITH THIS SETTING unless you want to lower the refresh rate or

#  limit of what the game is allowed to request.
#
MaximumRefreshRate = 240

## General framerate limit. Applies everywhere, except where more specific limits are set (see below).
#
#  Warning: This plugin replaces the built-in limiter by default, 'bLockFramerate' will have no effect.

## Adjusts fMaxTime and fMaxTimeComplex dynamically based on current framerate.
#
#  If set to false, fMaxTime and fMaxTimeComplex will be calculated and set automatically based on MaximumFramerate 
#  option (see below), but you'll lose the performance benefit which comes from re-adjusting these values each 
#  frame to match the framerate.
#
#  Consider 'false' as 'static' mode, which calculates physics values automatically so you
#  don't have to.
#
#  Read the description of MaximumFramerate option below for more info.
#
#  It's recommended to leave this enabled.
#
#  Note: In contrast to Havok Fix, the method used here is compatible with any third party OSD tools
#        such as RivaTuner Statistics Server, since it hooks in the engine instead of the D3D libraries.
#
DynamicMaxTimeScaling = true

## fMaxTime and fMaxTimeComplex are not calculated below

#  Default: 60 
#
MinimumFramerate = 60

## fMaxTime and fMaxTimeComplex are not calculated above this threshold.
#   
#  If DynamicMaxTimeScaling=true and this is set to 0, the plugin attempts to determine this value 
#  based on VSync (refresh rate) and FramerateLimit option. If it's unable to do so (for example if VSync
#  is off or mode is borderless fullscreen and no limit is set) it defaults to 240.
# 
#  If DynamicMaxTimeScaling=false, this setting is used to calculate fMaxTime and fMaxTimeComplex once and
#  apply both values. 
#  If DynamicMaxTimeScaling=false and this is set to 0, the plugin attempts to determine this value based 
#  on VSync/refresh rate and FramerateLimit option. If it's unable to do so, it defaults to 60.
#
#  If Fullscreen=true and EnableVSync=true or FramerateLimit is set, it's recommended you set this to 0
#  to let the plugin determine the value automatically.
#  Otherwise make sure it's set a comfortable margin higher than the maximum framerate your machine can 
#  achieve in-game (excluding menus and loading screens) or you will see physics issues. It's recommended
#  to set a framerate limit at or below this value (FramerateLimit option in Render section).

## Adjust the negative offset of fMaxTimeComplex relative to fMaxTime.
#
#  Valid range: 0 - 30
#
MaxTimeComplexOffset = 30

## Adjust amount of damage dealt when hit by physics objects based on frametime. 
#
#  Note that this doesn't fix the faster collision response, only alleviates higher health damage at 
#  higher framerates.
#
#  Since there's a good chance of getting killed in a misfortunate encounter with a kettle even at 60 FPS, 
#  you can reduce or disable damage dealt with PhysicsDamageMult (valid range: 0 - 1).
#
PhysicsDamagePatch = true
PhysicsDamageMult = 1

## Lowers HAVOK engine CPU consumption at the expense of physics simulation quality.

[Controls]

## Fixes an issue where you're not able to move in third person at high framerates.

## Speed multiplier for keyboard map movement.
#
#  Only in effect when MapMoveKeyboardSpeedFix=true.

#  Use [Controls] fPCDialogueLookStart in Skyrim.ini to set distance from the edge where the camera starts moving.
#
DialogueLookSmoothEdge = false

## Untie gamepad cursor speed from framerate.
#
#  Bethesda implemented this fix in 1.6.x (that's why this caused slow cursor movement) but they used
#  the wrong frame timer, one that's affected by global time multiplier. This patch corrects that and 
#  unties cursor movement from in-game timescale.
#
GamepadCursorSpeedFix = true

## Untie lockpick mouse rotation speed from framerate.
#
#  Note that this bug slows down rotation with higher framerates, if you got used to the
#  slower speed adjust [Interface] fPickMouseRotationSpeed in Skyrim.ini (default is 15).

#
#  Fixes the invisible runaway mouse glitch plaguing people with multiple monitors who keep a window
#  open on the neighboring monitor and it keeps scrolling while playing the game.
#
LockCursor = true

## Minimize the game window if it loses focus.
#
#  Useful in borderless fullscreen mode if alt-tabbing just pushes the game window to the background
#  instead of minimizing it.
#
#  WARNING: Avoid using this with ENB or ReShade, things might break when alt-tabbing.

[Papyrus]

## Set the maximum time scripts are allowed to run per cycle based on current framerate.
#
#  Normally scripts are given a fixed max. amount of execution time per cycle controlled by
#  fUpdateBudgetMS - 1.2 ms by default, roughly 7% of each cycle at 60 FPS, 17% at 144, 29% at
#  240, .. The higher your framerate, the harder it gets to sustain it under heavy script load.
#
#  This attempts to even things out by adjusting the limit based on time it took to complete 
#  the previous cycle. Less budget is alloted at higher framerates.
#
#  Formula:
#
#    fUpdateBudgetMS = lastCycleTime * (UpdateBudgetBase / 16.66667)
#
#  Note: fUpdateBudgetMS never goes above UpdateBudgetBase (see below).
#
DynamicUpdateBudget = false

## Amount of time scripts are alloted at or below 60 FPS (in milliseconds).

#
#  Bethesda default: 1.2
#
UpdateBudgetBase = 1.2

## Budget is not calculated beyond this limit.
#

#  If enabled, OSD will indicate when the scripting engine is under excessive load. 
#  Keep in mind that it's normal for the VM to become overstressed for short periods, 
#  for instance after fast travelling a bunch of events might fire at once. 
#  However if the indicator is constantly showing, you've got a problem. Usually poorly

[Miscellaneous]

## Disables scanning missing plugin .ini files. May significantly improve startup times with many plugins.
#
#  By default the engine looks for every single .ini option for each installed plugin, without checking
#  if the .ini file actually exists. Massive waste of time and resources, especially when the user has a
#  heavily modded game.
#
#  Note: This is unrelated to the PrivateProfileRedirector plugin and is fully compatible with it. If you
