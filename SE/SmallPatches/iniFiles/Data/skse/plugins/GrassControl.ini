This can be useful if you want grass to still grow from some objects (such as roads).The format is formid : formfile separated by; for example "1812A:Skyrim.esm;1812D:Skyrim.esm" would add RoadChunkL01 and RoadChunkL02 forms to ignore list.

Try disabling all settings except profiler, go to game and in main menu 'coc riverwood', after loading open console to see normal game time. Then enable settings and check again how it changed. Remember to coc from main menu instead of loading save because it might not be accurate otherwise.

;This will generate cache files in /Data/Grass/ and use those when we have them.

;Overwrite fGrassStartFadeDistance from any INI. If this is zero or higher then the grass distance will always be taken from this configuration instead of any INI.This can be useful if you have a million things overwriting your INI files and don't know what to edit, so you can just set it here. For example 7000 is vanilla highest in-game grass slider. If you want to set higher you need to enable ExtendGrassDistance setting as well or it will not look right in - game. What the setting actually means is that grass will start to fade out at this distance. Actual total grass distance is this value + fade range value.
Overwrite-grass-distance = 6000.000000

;Overwrite fGrassFadeRange from any INI. If this is zero or higher then the grass fade range will always be taken from this configuration instead of any INI. This determines the distance it takes for grass to completely fade out starting from OverwriteGrassDistance(or fGrassStartFadeDistance if you didn't use the overwrite). If you want the grass fade out to not be so sudden then increase this value.Probably recommended to keep this at least half of the other setting.
Overwrite-grass-fade-range = 3000.000000

;Overwrite iMinGrassSize from any INI. If this is zero or higher then the grass density setting (iMinGrassSize) will be taken from here instead of INI files. Lower values means more dense grass. 50 or 60 is normal mode with somewhat sparse grass(good performance).Lowering the value increases density !20 is very high density. You should probably not set lower than 20 if you decide to change it. The grass form density setting itself still mostly controls the actual density of grass, think of iMinGrassSize more of as a cap for that setting.
