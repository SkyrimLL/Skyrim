nexusDescription="[size=3]Whilst the real modding magicians re-work the lighting engine for SSE, this mod will help reduce problems associated with the game engine lighting issue which causes lights to flicker on/off whilst looking around if too many are active in the same location at the same time.\n<br />\n<br />For example, Paraphernalia Magicka and Ambience both stress the lighting limits and can cause flickering issues so this is a complimentary mod.\n<br />\n<br />This ESP is flagged as an ESM.\xa0 Manually load this in your mod manager, ie. immediately after Skyrim(VR).esm and before (if applicable) Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp.\n<br />\n<br />You should also notice a FPS improvement using this mod.\xa0 All it does is delete certain light sources similar to how Lux does, this mod just goes a bit further....I myself use it alongside Claralux, Lux, RAID weathers and the Paraphernalia mods and get both a FPS boost and more stable lighting.\xa0 Your mileage may vary...\n<br />\n<br />[b]I do not recommend moving this further down your load order and is intended to be loaded as described above in your Mod Manager. I use MO2.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />I hope this proves useful.\xa0 No scripts and should be OK to uninstall at anytime.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Other\xa0Paraphernalia\xa0Mods[/b][/u]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74923]\n<br />Snow Colour Fixes[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75742]Magicka\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77894]Ambience\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79119]End of Life[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81247]Lustre\n<br />\n<br />[/url][/size]Devilsplay77 has permission to port this mod to Xbox"
