[fps]
##fMaxTime won't update below this framerate (default/vanilla = 60)
##lower values might improve performance in areas where your pc struggles to reach 60fps but could also lead to physics glitches.
min=30

##fMaxTime won't update on higher framerates than "max". This is to help with infinite loadscreens if you get 1000+ fps in the main menu.
##You can leave it at the default value unless you're a madman and can achieve more than 240 fps in skyrim :^)
max=240

##fMaxTime will be updated every X milliseconds.
##Set freq to 0 to use the most precise update method (update every frame).
