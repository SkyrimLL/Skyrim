SkipFrames = 0       #May be increased to 1 or 2(or more) for more performance if your cpu is not up to it. But animation becomes less smooth. And bugs may appear at higher values.

SkipFramesPelvis = 0 #Not used that much and doesn't need too much calculation to be smooth. You can decrease this for smoother animation. Increase it for performance.

GridSize = 20        #This is for spatial hashing algorithm. Don't change this unless you know what you are doing!!!! Lower values cause shakes or collision to fail. Higher values would increase accuracy if there are larger node spheres defined. But performance would decrease a lot.

ActorDistance = 512	 #Actors beyond this distance are ignored for collision.

ActorBounceDistance = 1024 #Actors beyond this distance are ignored for bounce and collisions. I suggest leaving this at 4096. Bounce only is very performant.

ActorAngle = 120   	 #Actors beyond this angle are ignored. Setting it to 360 disables angle restriction. Setting it to 0 means only player will get physics.

UseCamera = 1        #Use camera position and angle to determine ActorAngle. Set to 0 if you are having issues with free camera etc. with some mods.

FpsCorrection = 1  #FPS correction mode for motions. Makes the bounce movement amount independent of fps, but can appear choppy on low fps. Disabling it would make it smooth even on low fps, but the bounce amount would change with fps.

InCombatActorCount = 25 #Actor count to process in combat, sorted by distance

OutOfCombatActorCount = 50 #Actor count to process out of combat, sorted by distance

Logging = 0	     #Set this to 1 to enable logging. Path is this: My Documents\My Games\Skyrim VR or Special Edition\SKSE\CBPC-Collision.log This decreases performance, so don't play with this on. Also the file generated will be huge if played long.

#For VR
HapticFrequency = 10  #Vibration frequency multiplier. Between 1 and 3999

HapticStrength = 1   #how many vibration loops. Change this to change vibration strength
